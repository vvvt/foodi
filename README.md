Prototypical app for getting canteen recommendations based on user's location and set preferences.

## About

As part of the course work [Application Development for Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/professur-fuer-rechnernetze/studium/lehrveranstaltungen/lehrveranstaltungsdetails?ln=en&lv_id=48) we were to develop an app tackling typical challenges of using mobile apps. We settled on an app that supports the user in finding good meals for lunch in one of the various canteens in Dresden.  

## Usage

### Sections

#### Meal Preferences

Set your meal preferences through various toggles and checkboxes. The app aims at the most common eating habits, such as Vegetarianism or Veganism 

#### Settings

Configure general app settings, such as language or data use. 

#### Meal Finder

Scroll through the list of meals to find your favourite one. The meals are ordered from top to bottom by distance from your location to the respective canteen. Pick a meal to see a more detailed view and to start navigating there.

#### Canteen Navigation

Follow the instructions based on Google Maps to find the closest canteen.
